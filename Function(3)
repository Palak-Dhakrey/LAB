QUESTION:Write a python function called caseCounter that counts the number of lowercase and uppercase characters in a string.If you're up to it,store the lowercase and uppercase variables in a dictionary wihtin the function. The function should print two sentences that state the number of uppercase and lowercase characters.
         def caseCounter(s):
             d={"UPPER_CASE":0,"LOWER_CASE":0}
             for c in s:
                 if c.isupper():
                     d['UPPER_CASE'] += 1
                 elif c.lower():
                     d['LOWER_CASE'] += 1
                 else:
                     pass
             print(f'No. of uppercase characters: {d['UPPER_CASE']}') 
             print(f'No. of lowercase characters: {d['LOWER_CASE']}')
